This mess of a movie is nothing short of a travestite comedy parody.,0
a pile-up of fifty cars of clichés.,0

This action/black comedy thriller is one of the most disgusting things to appear in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage.,0
MIB II is a film that allows the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or to do several errands to the concession stand and/or toilet and not have forgotten anything. That's because relatively nothing happens.,0
